PROJECT ONE GUIDELINES: 

Build a game engine that has the following abilities: 

1.	Startup and Shutdown of components
2.	Math Library
3.	Memory Management (pool or stack allocator) -- going with pool allocator

Demonstrate its basic capabilities by building unit tests				---- DONE
that allocate a large number (5,000 +) of vertices that are				---- !!!
then rotated, translated, and scaled using a 4x4 homogeneous matrix.	---- IN PROGRESS
Your library should also be capable of representing						
and working with quaternions.											---- DONE

Demonstrate this capability by generating a set of quaternions			---- DONE
and performing the basic operations of rotating a set of vectors with	---- DONE
a quaternion and then using the inverse to rotate it back.				---- DONE
Then show that you can rotate the same vectors using two separate		---- !!!
quaternions and then rotate them back to their original position.		---- !!!

PROJECT TWO GUIDELINES: 

Build a game engine that has the following abilities
1.	Startup and Shutdown of components
2.	Camera																---- DONE?
	Control																---- DONE
3.	Graphics primitives													---- DONE
a.	Sphere																---- 
b.	Quad																---- 
c.	Rectangle															---- DONE
d.	Pyramid																---- DONE
4.	Ability to texture primitives using an image format					---- 
5.	Math Library														---- DONE
6.	Memory Management (pool or stack allocator)							---- DONE
Demonstrate its basic capabilities by producing a 
primitive map that you can drive the camera through.  
Don’t worry about collision detections or object occlusion.


For textures, currently the library is unlinked to the resource file
GOODBOI.JPG is a stupid fix this issue later 

IF YOU NEED TO USE 'FILESYSTEM: STUFF' DON'T, JUST DELETE IT
Create the CMake source...build it


PROJECT THREE SPECIFICATIONS: 

1. Startup and Shutdown of components									---- NO
2. Camera Control														---- COMPLETELY DONE
3. Graphics Primitives:													---- DONE
	a. Sphere															---- DONE
	b. Quad...like a cube?												---- COMPLETELY DONE
	c. Rectangle														---- DONE
	d. Pyramid															---- DONE
4. Ability to texture primitives using an image format					---- COMPLETELY DONE
5. Math Library															---- FIX QUATERNIONS
6. Memory Management													---- DONE...(?)
7. Import Models and Textures											---- NO
8. Perform basic Character animation									---- NO
9. Integrate a basic physics engine										---- NO
10. Have lights (no shadows required)									---- NO

Demonstrate its basic capbilities by producing a map tht you can drive 
the camera through. The camera should interact with the environment 
including object collisions. The map must include 
an animated character of some type.
